# GridSens

This software is part of the joint EMRP project ENG63 GridSens. Project information under [gridsens.eu](http://gridsens.eu) or at [MATHMET](http://mathmet.org/projects/ENG63).

### Installation
Since this software is still under active development, we highly recommend to **not** download the zip-file of the current version only. Instead, we recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or any other git-compatible version control software and cloning the repository (https://github.com/eichstaedtPTB/GridSens.git). In this way, any updates to the software will be highlighted in the version control software and can be applied very easily. Of course, you may also *fork* the repository and suggest your changes as pull requests.

### Roadmap - next steps

1. Extend the nodal load observer extended Kalman filter to utilize measured power in the measurement equation.
2. Extend the nodal load observer to three-phase unbalanced conditions.
3. Implement static estimation in a way such that its results can be compared to those of the nodal load observer
4. Implement more examples and improve the documentation.
5. Implement unit testing.

This software was developed at Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). 
The software is made available "as is" free of cost. PTB assumes no responsibility whatsoever for its use by other parties, 
and makes no guarantees, expressed or implied, about its quality, reliability, safety, suitability or any other characteristic. 
In no event will PTB be liable for any direct, indirect or consequential damage arising in connection with the use of this software.
